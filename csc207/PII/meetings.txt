MINITES BOOKED ON MARCH 11TH 2015

We had a status meeting at 1pm on Mar 11th 2015 at SS lounge.
But the meeting took several hours to figure it out how to deal with
tree structured itinerary lists.

  Current status of the project as of Mar 11, 2015:
    * done: Driver.java, User.java, Administrator.java, Client.java
            ArrayDB.java, TravelConstants.java
    * implemented: Serialized ArrayDB, Flight, Client in order to save
                   them into serialized data.
    * almost done: Flight.java, Console.java
  
  Status meeting - 2 hours (all members attended):
    * Console.java needed to return itineraries from general trees
      implemented in Flight object. All members tried several methods
      to resolve it, but we all didn't find the right answer.
    * We decided to change the structure of storing Flight objects.
      At this time, we all agreed to store all possible itineraries
      into List<List<Flight>> aka nested list. In terms of efficiency
      we all agreed this is not the best solution for a large data set.
   
   Tasks:
     * Spencer: Re-construct the data structure for itineraries.
     * All other members: find the solution for sorting itineraries.
     
   Next meeting:
     * Mar 12, 2015 after CSC236 exam at 3pm at SS lounge.


MINUTES BOOKED ON MARCH 7TH 2015

Our planning meeting was held on March 6th 2015 at 12PM at Robart
Library - 12th Floor Sussex 2.

  Current status of the project as of Mar 6, 2015:
    * done: crc.pdf
    * done: decided who work on which part
    * implemented: blank .java files are created according to crc.pdf
    * almost done: none

  Tasks for the members which agreed upon in this meeting:
    * Chang: ArrayDB.java, Client.java
    * Yiyan (Stella): Flight.java
    * Yu (Liliy): Administrator.java, User.java
    * Spencer: Console.java, TravelConstants.java, Driver.java

  Plans for our next status meeting:
    * Either Tuesday Mar 10 or Wednesday Mar 11, 2015
    * Basically, all members implement each Java files before the next
      status meeting.
