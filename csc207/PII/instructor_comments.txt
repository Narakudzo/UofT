Dear group_0361,

I see that you implemented reading/writing serialized data in Phase II.  You are
a step ahead for Phase III!  Originally, none of the tests passed due to filepath
issues, but I was able to resolve that.  I changed the path from "src/FILENAME" to
simply "FILENAME".

Once I made that change, 8 of 13 tests passed.  You'll find the results in 
result.txt.
