1. In record(), recourdedData.set() may receive key index out of range
because the instance tail will increase infinitely. Need a line to
compute an appropriate index key number.

2. In getLastDataPoints(), updating tail instance variable mess up the
current index position. Need a local/temporary variable for the counter. 

3. In averate(), the total instance is devided by CAPACITY. The data
size may be less than CAPACIY. The denominator should be the size of
recordedData.

4. Due to the mess up of tail instance by getLastDataPoints(), record()
will experience out of range error or overriding the wrong index.
